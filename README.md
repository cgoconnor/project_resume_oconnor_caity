## Resources

    * I used this site to find plugins.

    * This is the plugin I used to animate the text of my name in the h1 element. I downloaded the files and followed the documentation to get it to work.
    * To interact with this plugin, load the page. The h1 ("Caity Grether O'Connor") should populate letter by letter with a wobble effect.

    * This is the plugin I used to "count up" to my phone number in the contact
    section. I downloaded the files and followed the documentation to get it to work.
    * To interact with this plugin, load the page. The last seven digits of the phone number should count up from zero.

## Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

## Comments
For my custom jQuery code, I added code that would toggle the background color of the h2 elements from the teal color to the purple color.
